就業統計數據是政策制定者用來衡量經濟整體實力的最重要指標之一。在美國，政府使用現有人口調查（CPS）衡量失業率，該調查每月收集來自各種美國人的人口統計和就業信息。在本練習中，我們將使用講座中審查的主題以及一些使用2013年9月版的，具有全國代表性的數據集。數據集中的觀察結果代表2013年9月CPS中實際完成調查的人員，完整數據集有385個欄位，但在本練習中，我們將使用數據集CPSData.csv版本，它具有以下欄位：

+ `PeopleInHousehold`: 受訪者家庭中的人數。
+ `Region`: 受訪者居住的人口普查區域。
+ `State`: 受訪者居住的州。
+ `MetroAreaCode`: 都會區代碼，如受訪者不住都會區，則為NA；從代碼到都會區名稱的對應在`MetroAreaCodes.csv`中提供。
+ `Age`: 受訪者的年齡，以年為單位。 80代表80-84歲的人，85代表85歲及以上的人。
+ `Married`: 受訪者的婚姻狀況。
+ `Sex`: 受訪者的性別。
+ `Education`: 受訪者獲得的最高教育程度。
+ `Race`: 受訪者的種族。
+ `Hispanic`: 受訪者是否屬於西班牙裔。
+ `CountryOfBirthcode`: 識別受訪者出生國家的代碼。從代碼到國家名稱的映射在CountryCodes.csv文件中提供。
+ `Citizenship`: 受訪者的公民身份。
+ `EmploymentStatus`: 受訪者的就業狀況。
+ `Industry`: 受訪者的就業行業（僅在受僱的情況下可用）。
